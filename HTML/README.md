# What is CRP (Critical Rendering Path)
It represents the sequence of steps a web browser executes to convert raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files into actual visual pixels displayed on a user's screen.
The 5 Steps of the Critical Rendering PathThe path consists of five distinct, progressive stages:
1. DOM Construction (Document Object Model): The browser parses raw HTML bytes into characters,tokens, and nodes.It organizes these nodes into a tree structure representing the document structure.
2. CSSOM Construction (CSS Object Model): The browser processes CSS styles discovered in <link> or <style> tags.It builds a tree data structure holding the styling information for all elements.
3. Render Tree Creation: The browser merges the DOM and CSSOM trees into a single "Render Tree".This tree contains only the visible elements that will be rendered on the screen (e.g., elements set to display: none are excluded).
4. Layout (Reflow)The browser calculates the exact geometry, size, and position of each visible element on the page relative to the device viewport.
5. Paint (Repaint)The browser fills in the actual pixels on the screen, rendering text, colors, images, shadows, and borders.
